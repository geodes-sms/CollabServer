 * \brief
 * Defines the set of callback functions the CollabServer core may call.
 *
 * This may be used by the network component for instance, to broadcast events
 * from CollabServer. (Such as operation in room etc).
 *
 * \note
 * Note about IDs:
 * ID removes coupling between broadcaster and core business components.
 * For instance, ID may be the user ID in business side, and a simple
 * ID linked with a socket in network side.
