## Overview

---

Server for realtime collaboration on any `CollabData` from `collab-data-crdts`
project.

- **User point of view**:
 a Collaborative room is a current instance of collaboration where several
 users are working on the same Data. The data itself is any implementation
 of `CollabData` interface with a set of `Operation` implemented
 (See `collab-data-crdts`).
- **In server**:
 the server doesn't know anything about the concrete data implementation.
 A room only store the list of operations applied since the beginning.
 The server deals with the broadcasting system and ensure that all users in
 a room receive each operations.

## Getting Started

---

1. Clone project with submodules
    - Clone with recursive: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/CollabServer/collabserver-server.git`
    - To pull changes from submodules, uses: `git pull --recurse-submodules=on`
    - For further informations about submodules, check the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
1. Build the server
    - Be sure you have all the requirements
    - Build collabserver-server (See build instructions)
1. Start the server
    - Open a console and run the collabserver executable
    - Logs are displayed here
    - Ctrl+C to stop server
1. Connect users
    - Users implement the [collabserver-client](https://github.com/CollabServer/collabserver-client) to connect with Server
    - Server port is 4242
    - Local IP is localhost
    - The [collabserver-grapheditor](https://github.com/CollabServer/collabserver-grapheditor) is a full example client using this server

## Contribution

Feel free to ask me any question, share your ideas or open an issue.
I started this project during my master thesis at University of Montreal.
Format uses clang-format with the Google Coding style <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html> (see `.clang-format` for further information).
Make sure you autoformat on save (see <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>)
