 * Last-Writer-Wins Register (LWW Register).
 * CvRDT (State-based).

 * Timestamp is assigned to each update and creates a total order of updates.
 *
 * \note
 * Quote from the CRDT article "A comprehensive study of CRDT":
 *
 * "
 * A Last-Writer-Wins Register (LWW-Register) creates a total order of
 * assignments by associating a timestamp with each update.
 * Timestamps are assumed unique, totally ordered, and consistent with causal
 * order; i.e., if assignment 1 happened-before assignment 2,
 * the former's timestamp is less than the latter's. This may be implemented as
 * a per-replicate counter concatenated with a unique replica identifier,
 * such as its MAC address.
 * "
 *
 * \warning
 * Timestamps must have a total order.
 * Two equal timestamps (t1 == t1 returns true) is undefined and replicated
 * may diverge. (See implementation).
 * (Ex: use a mix of datetime + user id for instance).
 *
 *
 * \tparam T    Type of element.
 * \tparam Key  Timestamps key.
